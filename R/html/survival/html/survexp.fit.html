<h2>Work Function to Compute Expected Survival</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Compute expected survival. This function is not to be called by the user.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
survexp.fit(x, y, times, death, ratetable)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
a matrix. The first column contains the group,
an integer value that divides the subjects into subsets.
Remaining columns must match the dimensions of the <code>ratetable</code>,
in the correct order.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
the follow up time for each subject.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>times</code></td>
<td>
the vector of times at which a result will be computed.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>death</code></td>
<td>
death indicator</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ratetable</code></td>
<td>
a rate table, such as <code>survexp.uswhite</code>.
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
For cohort survival it must be the potential censoring time for
each subject, ignoring death.
</p>
<p>
For an exact estimate <code>times</code> should be a superset of <code>y</code>, so that each
subject at risk is at risk for the entire sub-interval of time.
For a large data set, however, this can use an inordinate amount of
storage and/or compute time.  If the <code>times</code> spacing is more coarse than
this, an actuarial approximation is used which should, however, be extremely
accurate as long as all of the returned values are &gt; .99.
</p>
<p>
For a subgroup of size 1 and <code>times</code> &gt; <code>y</code>,
the conditional method reduces to exp(-h) where
h is the expected cumulative hazard for the subject over his/her
observation time.  This is used to compute individual expected survival.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
A list containing the number of subjects and the expected survival(s)
at each time point.
If there are multiple groups, these will be
matrices with one column per group.</p>

<h3>WARNING</h3>

<p>
Most users will call the higher level routine <code>survexp</code>.
Consequently, this function has very few error checks on its input arguments.
