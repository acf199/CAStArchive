<h2>Heat Evolved by Setting Cements</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Experiment on the heat evolved in the setting of each of 13
cements.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
cement
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<dl>
<dt><code>x1, x2, x3, x4</code></dt><dd>Proportions (%) of active ingredients
</dd>
<dt><code>y</code></dt><dd>heat evolved in cals/gm
</dd></dl>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
13 samples of Portland cement were set. For each sample, the percentages of the
four main chemical ingredients was accurately measured.  While the cement was
setting the amount of heat evolved was also measured.
