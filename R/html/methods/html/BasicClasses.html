<h2>Classes Corresponding to Basic Data Types</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Formal classes exist corresponding to the basic R data types, allowing
these types to be used in method signatures, as slots in class
definitions, and to be extended by new classes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
### The following are all basic vector classes.
### They can appear as class names in method signatures,
### in calls to as(), is(), and new().
"character"
"complex"
"double"
"expression"
"integer"
"list"
"logical"
"numeric"
"single"
"raw"

### the class
"vector"
### is a virtual class, extended by all the above

### The following are additional basic classes
"NULL"     #  NULL objects
"function" #  function objects, including primitives
"externalptr" # raw external pointers for use in C code

"ANY"  # virtual classes used by the methods package itself
"VIRTUAL"
"missing"
</pre>


<h3>Objects from the Classes</h3>

<p>
Objects can be created by calls of the form <code>new(Class, ...)</code>,
where <code>Class</code> is the quoted class name, and the remaining
arguments if any are objects to be interpreted as vectors of this
class.  Multiple arguments will be concatenated.
</p>
<p>
The class <code>"expression"</code> is slightly odd, in that the ...
arguments will <EM>not</EM> be evaluated; therefore, don't enclose them
in a call to <code>quote()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Extends</h3>

<p>
Class <code>"vector"</code>, directly.
</p>


<h3>Methods</h3>

<dl>
<dt>coerce</dt><dd>Methods are defined to coerce arbitrary objects to
these classes, by calling the corresponding basic function, for
example, <code>as(x, "numeric")</code> calls <code>as.numeric(x)</code>. </dd>
</dl>
