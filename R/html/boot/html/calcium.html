<h2>Calcium Uptake Data</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
The <code>calcium</code> data frame has 27 rows and 2 columns.
</p>
<p>
Howard Grimes from the Botany Department, North Carolina State University,
conducted an experiment for biochemical analysis of intracellular storage
and transport of calcium across plasma membrane.  Cells were
suspended in a solution of radioactive calcium for a certain length of time and
then the amount of radioactive calcium that was absorbed by the cells was
measured.  The experiment was repeated independently with 9 different
times of suspension each replicated 3 times.
