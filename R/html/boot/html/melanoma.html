<h2>Survival from Malignant Melanoma</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
The <code>melanoma</code> data frame has 205 rows and 7 columns.
</p>
<p>
The data consist of measurements made on patients with malignant melanoma.
Each patient had their tumour removed by surgery at the Department of Plastic
Surgery, University Hospital of Odense, Denmark during the period 1962 to 1977.
The surgery consisted of complete removal of the tumour together with about
2.5cm of the surrounding skin.  Among the measurements taken were the thickness
of the tumour and whether it was ulcerated or not.  These are thought to be
important prognostic variables in that patients with a thick and/or ulcerated
tumour have an increased chance of death from melanoma.
Patients were followed until the end of 1977.
