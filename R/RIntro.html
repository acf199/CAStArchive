<br>
The astronomical community has a vast complex of on-line
databases.&nbsp; Many databases are hosted by data centers such as <a
 href="http://www.adccc.org/members.html">NASA's archive research
centers</a>, the <a href="http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/">Centre des
Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS)</a>, the <a
 href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/">NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database
(NED)</a>, and the <a
 href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html">Astrophysics
Data System (ADS)</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Virtual Observatory (VO) is developing new flexible tools for
accessing, mining and combining datasets at distributed
locations;&nbsp; see
the Web sites for the <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/">international</a>,
<a href="http://www.euro-vo.org/">European</a>, and <a
 href="http://us-vo.org/">U.S</a>. VO for information on recent
developments.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.voservices.org/">VO Web
Services</a>, <a href="http://www.us-vo.org/summer-school/">Summer
Schools</a>, and <a href="http://us-vo.org/apps/">Core Applications</a>
provide helpful entries into these new capabilities.<br>
<br>
We initially treat here only input of tabular data such as catalogs of
astronomical sources.&nbsp; We give two examples of interactive
acquisition
of tabular data.&nbsp; One of the multivariate tabular datasets used
here is
a dataset of stars observed with the European Space Agency's Hipparcos
satellite during the 1990s.&nbsp; It gives a table with 9 columns and
2719 rows giving Hipparcos stars lying between 40 and 50 parsecs from
the Sun. The dataset was acquired using CDS's <a
 href="http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/">Vizier Catalogue Service</a> as
follows:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Web browser, go&nbsp; <a

<br>
</span></small></span></span></big></big>Enter R by typing "R"
(UNIX) or double-clicking to execute Rgui.exe (Windows).&nbsp; In the
commands below, we start by extracting
some <a
 href="html/base/html/Sys.info.html">system
and user information</a>, the <a
 href="html/base/html/Version.html">R.version</a>
you are using, and some of its <a
 href="html/base/html/capabilities.html">capabilities</a>.&nbsp;
There are more advanced functions to create, open and close <a
 href="html/base/html/connections.html">connections</a>
to (compressed) files, pipes, urls, and sockets.&nbsp; Files can be
opened for reading or writing in text or binary modes.&nbsp; <a
 href="html/utils/html/citation.html">citation</a>
tells how to cite R in publications.&nbsp; R is released under the GNU
Public Licence, as indicated by <a
 href="html/base/html/copyright.html">copyright</a>.

&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">?copyright</span><br> 
<br> 
Note:  R is 
case-sensitive. The up-arrow key can retrieve previous commands, 
which may be edited. <br> 
<br> 
Second, we navigate R to the work 
directory containing the ASCII dataset.&nbsp; <a
 href="html/base/html/list.files.html">list.files</a>
has a variety of useful options, and is only one of several utilities
interfacing to the computer's <a
 href="html/base/html/files.html">files</a>.
 In the 
 <a href="html/base/html/getwd.html">setwd</a> 
 command, note that in Windows, path (directory) names are not case-sensitive and
 may contain either forward slashes or backward slashes; in the latter case,
 a backward slash must be written as "\\" when enclosed in quotation marks. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">setwd("c:/data_directory")</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">getwd()</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">list.files()</span><br>
<br>
A user-provided ASCII table is converted into R's `data frame' using <a
 href="html/base/html/read.table.html">read.table</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here are two examples which read the table and convert it into an array
named "x".:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"># These are examples only; they will (probably) produce errors:</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">x = read.table("MyData1",
header=TRUE, comment.char="%")</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">x = read.table("c:\\documents
and settings\\MyName\\Desktop\\MyData.tsv", sep="|", na.strings="-9")</span><br>
<br>
<br>
The "#" mark is used for internal
comments within the R commands.&nbsp; 
The default column separators are spaces or tabs. If header=TRUE,
variable names are assumed to occupy the first line.&nbsp; Variable
names may not have embedded spaces, and non-alphanumeric characters
(such as "_") are converted to ".".&nbsp; Full astronomical
headers (e.g. FITS, VOTable) should be commented out with
comment.char.&nbsp; Empty cells, or cells with na.strings values, are
considered to be <a
 href="html/base/html/NA.html">Not
Available (NA)</a>, a T/F logical constant. This can be tested later
using <a href="html/base/html/NA.html">is.na</a>(x),
or removed from consideration using <a
 href="html/stats/html/na.fail.html">na.omit</a>(x).&nbsp;
Mistakes in the data file are often returned as <a
 href="html/base/html/is.finite.html">Not
a Number (NaN)</a>. <br>
<br>
As preparation for the exercises to follow, we now download a cleaned-up version of
the Hipparcos dataset described above into R.  The first step is to copy the file 
<a href="http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/datasets/HIP_star.dat">HIP_star.dat</a>, found at 
<a href="http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/datasets/HIP_star.html">
http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/datasets/HIP_star.html</a>, into some directory and
then use the setwd command to change the working directory to this directory.  Then, type<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">x = read.table("HIP_star.dat",header=T,fill=T)</span><br>
<br>

Characterize the dataset<br>
<br>
</span></small></span></span></big></big>The following R commands list
the <a href="html/base/html/dim.html">dimensions</a>
of the dataset and print the variable <a
 href="html/base/html/names.html">names</a>
(from the single-line header).&nbsp; Then
we list the first row, and list the first 20 rows for the 7th
column.&nbsp; Finally, we find the <a
 href="html/base/html/sum.html">sum</a>
of the 3rd column.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">dim(x)</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">names(x) </span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">x[1,]</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">x[1:20,7]</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">sum(x[,3])</span><br>
<br>
List the
<a href="html/base/html/Extremes.html">maximum</a>,
<a href="html/base/html/Extremes.html">minimum</a>,
<a href="html/base/html/mean.html">mean</a>,
<a href="html/stats/html/median.html">median</a>, and
<a href="html/stats/html/mad.html">mean absolute deviation</a>
(similar to standard deviation)&nbsp; of each column.&nbsp; First we do
this using a 
<a href="html/base/html/Control.html">for</a>-loop,
which is a slow process in R.&nbsp; <a
 href="html/base/html/c.html">c</a> is
a generic R function that combines its arguments into a vector. Then we
do it in a more efficient fashion using the apply command.&nbsp; Here
the "2" refers to columns in the x array; a "1" would refer to
rows.&nbsp; <a
 href="html/base/html/print.html">print</a>
is a generic R command that prints the result. <a
 href="html/base/html/colSums.html">colMeans</a>
is faster than the apply command.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">for(i in 1:ncol(x)) {</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
print(c(max(x[,i]), min(x[,i]), median(x[,i]), mad(x[,i]))) </span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">}</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">apply(x, 2, max) </span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">apply(x, 2, min) </span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">apply(x, 2, median) </span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">apply(x, 2, mad)</span> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">colMeans(x)</span> <br>
<br>
Note that the curly braces {} in the for loop above are optional because there is
only a single command inside.<br>
<br>
A vector can be <a
 href="html/base/html/sort.html">sorted</a>
using the Shellsort or Quicksort
algorithms; <a
 href="html/base/html/rank.html">rank</a>
returns the order 
of values in a numeric vector; and <a
 href="html/base/html/order.html">order</a>
returns a vector of indices that will sort a vector.  The last of these functions,
order, is often the most useful of the three, because it allows one to reorder all
of the rows of a matrix according to one of the columns:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">sort(x[1:10,3])</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">x[order(x[1:10,3]),]</span><br>
<br>
Each of the above lines gives the sorted values of the first ten entries of the
third column, but the second line reorders <i>each</i> of the ten rows in this order.  Note 
that neither of these commands actually alters the value of x, but we could reassign
x to equal its sorted values if desired.<br>

 style="font-weight: bold;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Learning R syntax</span></small></span></span></big></big><br>
<br>
<a href="html/base/html/Arithmetic.html">Arithmetic</a>
in R is straightforward.&nbsp; Some common operators are: + for
addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division, %/%
for integer division,&nbsp; %% for modular arithmetic,  ^ for exponentiation.&nbsp; 
The help page for these operators may accessed by typing, say,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">?'+'</span><br>
<br>
Some common
built-in functions are <a
 href="html/base/html/Log.html">exp</a>
for the exponential function, <a
 href="html/base/html/Math.html">sqrt</a>
for square root, <a
 href="html/base/html/Log.html">log10</a>
for base-10 logarithms, and <a
 href="html/base/html/Trig.html">cos</a>
for cosine. The syntax resembles "sqrt(z)".&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
 href="html/base/html/Comparison.html">Comparisons</a>
are made using &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal), ==
(equal to) with the syntax "a &gt;= b".&nbsp; To test whether a and b
are exactly equal and return a TRUE/FALSE value (for instance, in an
"if" statement), use the command <a
 href="html/base/html/identical.html">identical</a>(a,b)
rather a==b.&nbsp; Compare the following two ways of comparing the vectors a and b:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">a=c(1,2);b=c(1,3)</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">a==b</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">identical(a,b)</span><br>
<br>
Also note that in the above example, 'all(a==b)' is equivalent to 'identical(a,b)'.<br>
<br>
R also has other <a
 href="html/base/html/Logic.html">logical</a>
operators such as &amp; (AND), | (OR), ! (NOT).  There is also an xor (exclusive or)
function.  Each of these four functions performs elementwise comparisons in much the same
way as arithmetic operators:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">a=c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE);b=c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">!a</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">a &amp; b</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">a | b</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">xor(a,b)</span><br>
<br>
However, when 'and' and 'or' are used in programming, say in 'if' statements,
generally the '&amp;&amp;' and '||' forms are preferable.  These longer forms of 'and' 
and 'or' evaluate left to right, examining only the first element of each vector, 
and evaluation terminates when a result is determined.
Some other operators are listed <a
 href="html/base/html/Syntax.html">here</a>.<br>
<br>
It is important to understand how R uses the "=" sign.&nbsp; The
syntax "y &lt;- 22" means "y is assigned the value 22".&nbsp; Recently,
R has been changed to accept the syntax "y = 22" to have the same
meaning; we use this latter terminology here, although most
documentation is older and uses the "&lt;-" terminology.&nbsp; The
expression "y == x^2" evaluates as TRUE or FALSE, depending upon whether
y equals x squared, and performs no assignment.<br>
<br>
Let's continue with simple characterization of the dataset: find the
row number of the object with the smallest value of
the 4th column using which.min.&nbsp; A longer, but instructive, way to
accomplish this task creates a long vector of logical constants (tmp),
mostly FALSE with one TRUE, then pick out the row with "TRUE".&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; which.min(x[,4])</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
tmp= (x[,4]==min(x[,4])) </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1:nrow(x))[tmp]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #&nbsp;&nbsp; or equivalently, </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; which(tmp) </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The <a href="html/base/html/cut.html">cut</a>
function divides the range of x into intervals and codes the values of
x according to which interval they fall.&nbsp; It this is a quick way
to group a vector into bins.&nbsp; Use the "breaks" argument to either
specify a vector of bin boundaries, or give the number of intervals
into which x should be cut.&nbsp; Bin string labels can be
specified.&nbsp; Cut converts numeric vectors into an R object of
class&nbsp; "<a
 href="html/base/html/factor.html">factor</a>"
which can be ordered and otherwise manipulated; e.g. with command <a
 href="html/base/html/levels.html">levels</a>.&nbsp;
A more flexible method for dividing a vector into groups using
user-specified rules is given by <a
 href="html/base/html/split.html">split</a>.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">table(cut(x[,"Plx"],breaks=20:25))</span><br>
<br>
The command above uses several tricks.  Note that a column in a matrix may be referred to by its
name (e.g., "Plx") instead of its number.  The notation '20:25' is short for 'c(20,21,22,23,24,25)'
and in general, 'a:b' is the vector of consecutive 
integers starting with a and ending with b (this also works
if a is larger than b).  Finally, the 
<a href="html/base/html/table.html">table</a> command 
tabulates the values in a vector or factor.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dealing
with blank cells</span></small></span></span></big></big><br>
<br>
We may want to characterize the blank cells for which R has inserted
the value NA.&nbsp; First, we use is.na to produce a matrix, the same
size as x, with TRUE entries where NA appears.&nbsp; The <a
 href="html/base/html/sum.html">sum</a>
command here will coerce TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0, and add the matrix
to give the total number of NA's in x.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">sum(is.na(x)) </span><br>
<br>
Now we print the whole row wherever an NA is found.&nbsp; First, we
create a function called 'f' and use it in the apply command
analogously to the built-in functions mean and median above.&nbsp; tmp
here is a vector of TRUE and FALSE, where a TRUE indicates that the corresponding
row in x has an NA.  The last command displays all such rows.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">f = function(a)
any(is.na(a)) </span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">tmp=apply(x,1,f) </span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">x[tmp,] </span><br>
<br>
We can do the same operation without using the "tmp" array in a more
elegant, but less obvious, fashion:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">x[apply(x,1,function(t)
any(is.na(t))),]</span><br>
<br>
The <a
 href="html/base/html/write.html">write</a>
command is used to create a text file of an object. 
Alternatives to the write command include 
<a
 href="html/base/html/write.table.html">write.table</a>,
and <a
 href="html/MASS/html/write.matrix.html">write.matrix</a>.&nbsp;
write.matrix is most efficient for large datasets, but requires that
you load the MASS package.&nbsp; All of these commands produce text versions of R objects.
To save R objects solely for loading later into R, use the function
<a
 href="html/base/html/save.html">save</a>.
R objects that have been saved
can later be reacquired using <a
 href="html/base/html/load.html">load</a>.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">library(MASS)</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">write.matrix(x[tmp,],file="Rows_with_NA.dat")
</span><br>
<br>
The last command created a file in the current directory; feel free to verify its contents!<br>
<br>
The user ends an R session by typing the 
<a href="html/base/html/quit.html">q()</a> command.  At this point, R will ask 
whether to save the workspace image.  If the user chooses "yes", then all of the 
objects currently in memory are stored in a file called .RData and the commands 
typed during the session are appended to the .Rhistory file.  These objects are 
automatically loaded when R is next invoked from that directory, and the old commands 
may be accessed using the up-arrow key.<br>
<br>
<br>

 style="font-weight: bold;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">R
scripts</span></small></span></span></big></big><br>
<br>
While R is often run interactively, one often wants to carefully
construct R scripts and run them later.&nbsp;  A file containing R code can be run using the <a
 href="html/base/html/source.html">source</a>
command.  In addition, R may be run in batch mode.<br>
<br>
The editor Emacs, together with "<a href="http://ess.r-project.org/">Emacs speaks statistics</a>",
provides a nice way to produce R scripts.
