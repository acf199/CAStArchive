      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Astronomical background </span></p>
      <p>Galaxies are fundamental structures in the Universe.&nbsp; Our
Sun lives in the Milky Way Galaxy we can see as a patchy band of light
across the sky.&nbsp; The components of a typical galaxy are: a vast
number of stars (total mass ~10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> M<sub>o</sub>
where M<sub>o</sub> is the unit of a solar mass), a complex
interstellar medium of gas and dust from which stars form (typically
1-100% of the stellar component mass), a single supermassive black hole
at the center (typically &lt;1% of the stellar component mass), and a
poorly understood component called Dark Matter with mass ~5-10-times
all the other components combined. </p>
      <p>Over the ~14 billion years since the Big Bang,&nbsp; the rate
at which
galaxies convert interstellar matter into stars has not been constant,
and thus the brightness and color of galaxies change with cosmic
time.&nbsp; This phenomenon has several names in the astronomical
community: the history of star formation in the Universe, chemical
evolution of galaxies, or simply galaxy evolution.&nbsp; A major effort
over several decades has been made to quantify and understand galaxy
evolution using telescopes at all wavelengths. </p>
      <p>The traditional tool for such studies has been optical
spectroscopy
which easily reveals signatures of star formation in nearby
galaxies.&nbsp; However, to study star formation in the galaxies
recently emerged after the Big Bang, we must examine extremely faint
galaxies which are too faint for spectroscopy, even using the biggest
available telescopes.&nbsp; A feasible alternative is to obtain images
of faint galaxies at random locations in the sky in narrow spectral
bands, and thereby construct crude spectra.&nbsp; First, statistical
analysis of such multiband photometric datasets are used to classify
galaxies, stars and quasars.&nbsp; Second, for the galaxies,
multivariate regression is made to develop photometric estimates of
redshift, which is a measure both of distance from us and age since the
Big Bang.&nbsp; Third, one can examine galaxy colors as a function of
redshift (after various corrections are made) to study the evolution of
star formation. The present dataset is taken after these first two
steps are complete.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dataset</span></p>
      <p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403666">Wolf et al.
(2004)</a>
provide the first public catalog of a large dataset
(63,501 objects) with brightness measurements in 17 bands in the
visible band.&nbsp; (Note that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey provides a
much larger dataset of 10<sup>8</sup> objects with measurements in 5
bands.)&nbsp; We provide here a subset of their catalog with 65 columns
of information on 3,462 galaxies.&nbsp; These are objects in the
Chandra Deep Field South field which Wolf and colleagues have
classified as `Galaxies'.&nbsp; The column headings are formally
described in their Table 3, and the columns we provide are summarized
here with brief commentary:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Col 1:&nbsp; Nr, object number</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Col 2-3: Total R (red band) magnitude and
its
error.&nbsp; This was the band at which the basic catalog was
constructed.&nbsp; Magnitudes are inverted logarithmic measures of
brightness.&nbsp; A&nbsp; galaxy with R=21 is 100-times brighter than
one with R=26.&nbsp; The error is the standard deviation derived from
detailed knowledge of the measurement process.&nbsp; This dataset is an
excellent example of astronomical datasets where each variable is
accompanied by heteroscedastic measurement errors of known
variances.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Col 4-5:&nbsp; ApDRmag is the difference
between the
total and aperture magnitude in the R band.&nbsp; This is a rough
measure of the size of the galaxy in the image where ApDRmag=0
corresponds to a point source.&nbsp; Negative values are not physically
meaningful.&nbsp; mu_max is the central surface brightness of the
object in the R band.&nbsp; The difference between Rmag and mu_max
should also be an indicator of galaxy size.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Col 6-9: Mcz and MCzml are two redshift estimates.&nbsp;
Mcz is the preferred value.&nbsp; e.Mcz is its estimated error, and
chi2red is the reduced chi-squared value of the least-squares fit of
the 17-band magnitudes to the best-fit template galaxy spectrum.&nbsp;
Galaxies with large e.Mcz or chi2red might be omitted as unreliable.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Col 10-29: These give the absolute magnitudes
(i.e.
intrinsic luminosities) of the galaxy in 10 bands, with their
measurement errors.&nbsp; They are based on the measured magnitudes and
the redshifts, and represent the intrinsic luminosities of the
galaxies; a galaxy with M=-15 is 100-times less luminous than one with
M=-20. &nbsp;&nbsp; These magnitudes are not all independent of each
others, but the are important for representing intrinsic properties of
the galaxies.&nbsp; Below is one of several redshift-stratified plots
of the B-band absolute magnitude (abscissa) against the difference of
magnitude (i.e. ratio of luminosities) between the 2800A ultraviolet
and blue band, which is a sensitive indicator of star formation.&nbsp;
A redshift-dependent bimodal distribution is seen.&nbsp; </p>

 alt="Galaxy color distribution" src="COMBO17.jpg"
 style="width: 532px; height: 490px;"></div>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Col 30-55:&nbsp;
Observed
brightnesses in 13 bands in sequence from 420 nm in the ultraviolet to
915 nm in the far red.&nbsp; These are given in linear variables with
units of photon flux densities, photons/m<sup>2</sup>/s/nm.&nbsp;
Again, each measurement is accompanied by a measurement error which can
be used to distinguish measurement from intrinsic dispersions in the
distributions.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Col 56-65: Observed brightnesses in 5 traditional
broad
spectral bands, UBVRI.&nbsp; These are largely redundant with the 13
bands in the previous columns.&nbsp; </p>
      <br>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Statistical exercises </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Examine basic characteristics of the survey which are not
of
scientific interest.&nbsp; These include the absence of high-redshift
(i.e. distant) high-absolute-magnitude (i.e. faint) galaxies; the
dropoff in flux with redshift; the dropoff in image size with redshift.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Reproduce the plot above, segregate the two populations of
redder
and bluer galaxies. and characterize each population in the 13-band
space.</li>
        <li>Study these two populations as a function of redshift to
investigate the evolution of star formation. <br>
