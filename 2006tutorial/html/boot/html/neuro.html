<h2>Neurophysiological Point Process Data</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
<code>neuro</code> is a matrix containing times of observed firing of a neuron in windows
of 250ms either side of the application of a stimulus to a human subject.
Each row of the matrix is a replication of the experiment and there were a 
total of 469 replicates.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
There are a lot of missing values in the matrix as different numbers of 
firings 
were observed in different replicates.  The number of firings observed varied 
from 2 to 6.
</p>

<p>
The data were collected and kindly made available by Dr. S.J. Boniface of the
Neurophysiology Unit at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford.
