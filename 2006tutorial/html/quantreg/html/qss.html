<h2>Additive Nonparametric Terms for rqss Fitting</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
In the formula specification of <code>rqss</code> nonparametric terms 
are specified with <code>qss</code>.  Both univariate and bivariate
specifications are possible, and qualitative constraints may also be specified
for the qss terms.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
qss(x, constraint = "N", lambda = 1, ndum = 0, dummies = NULL, w = rep(1, length(x)))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
The covariate determining the nonparametric component, if
x is a matrix with two columns then  the qss
function will construct a penalized triogram term.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lambda</code></td>
<td>
The smoothing parameter governing the tradeoff between
fidelity and the penalty component for this term.  In future
versions there should be an automatic mechanism for default
choice of the lambdas.  For now, this is the responsibility
of the user.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>constraint</code></td>
<td>
Optional specification of qualitative constraints 
on the fitted univariate qss functions, take the values: "N","I","D","U","C"
"UI","UD","CI","CD" for none, increasing, decreasing, convex,
concave, convex and increasing, etc.  And for bivariate qss
components can take the values "N","U","C" for none, convex, and concave.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ndum</code></td>
<td>
number of dummy vertices: this is only relevant for qss2
terms.  In addition to vertices at the observed (x,y) points
ndum dummy vertices are generated &ndash; distributed uniformly over
the rectangle given by the Cartesian product of the ranges of
x and y &ndash; observations that fall in the convex hull of the 
observations are retained. So the actual number of dummy
vertices used is smaller than ndum.  The values of these 
vertices are returned in the list dummies, so that they can
be reused.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dummies</code></td>
<td>
list of dummy vertices as generated, for example by
triogram.fidelity when ndum &gt; 0.  Should be a list with x
and y components.  These points should lie inside the convex
hull of the real xy points, but no explicit checking of this
assertion is currently done.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>w</code></td>
<td>
weights not yet unimplemented </td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The various pieces returned are stored in sparse matrix.csr form.
See <code>rqss</code> for details on how they are assembled.  To preserve the
sparsity of the design matrix the first column of each qss term is dropped.
This differs from the usual convention that would have forced qss terms
to have mean zero.  This convention has implications for prediction that need to be
recognized.  The penalty components for qss terms are based on total
variation penalization of the first derivative (and gradient, for bivariate x)
as described in the references appearing in the help for <code>rqss</code>.

<h3>Value</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>F</code></td>
<td>
Fidelity component of the design matrix</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dummies</code></td>
<td>
List of dummy vertices</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>A</code></td>
<td>
Penalty component of the design matrix</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>R</code></td>
<td>
Constraint component of the design matrix</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>r</code></td>
<td>
Constraint component of the rhs</td></tr>
