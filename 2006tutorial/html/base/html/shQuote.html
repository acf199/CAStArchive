<h2>Quote Strings for Use in OS Shells</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Quote a string to be passed to an operating system shell.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
shQuote(string, type = c("sh", "csh", "cmd"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>string</code></td>
<td>
a character vector, usually of length one.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
character: the type of shell.  Partial matching is
supported.  <code>"cmd"</code> refers to the Windows NT shell, and is the
default under Windows.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The default type of quoting supported under Unix-alikes is that for
the Bourne shell <code>sh</code>.  If the string does not contain single
quotes, we can just surround it with single quotes.  Otherwise, the
string is surrounded in double quotes, which suppresses all special
meanings of metacharacters except dollar, backquote and backslash, so
these (and of course double quote) are preceded by backslash.  This
type of quoting is also appropriate for <code>ksh</code>, <code>zsh</code> and
<code>bash</code>.
</p>
<p>
The other type of quoting is for the C-shell (<code>csh</code> and
<code>tcsh</code>).  Once again, if the string does not contain single
quotes, we can just surround it with single quotes.  If it does
contain single quotes, we can use double quotes provided it does not
contain dollar or backquote (and we need to escape backslash,
exclamation mark and double quote).  As a last resort, we need to
split the string into pieces not containing single quotes and surround
each with single quotes, and the single quotes with double quotes.
</p>
<p>
The Windows shell supports only double quoting.  All this
implementation does is to surround by double quotes and escape
internal double quotes by a backslash.  As Windows path names cannot
contain double quotes, this makes <code>shQuote</code> safe for use with
<code><a href="system.html">system</a></code> and with <code><a href="shell.html">shell</a></code> if the default shell
is used.
</p>
<p>
It will usually be safe to use <code>shQuote</code> to quote arguments of a
command, but because <code><a href="system.html">system</a></code> does not use a shell,
interpretation of quoted arguments is done by the run-time code of the
executable.

<pre>
test &lt;- "abc$def`gh`i\j"
cat(shQuote(test), "\n")
## Not run: system(paste("echo", shQuote(test)))
test &lt;- "don't do it!"
cat(shQuote(test), "\n")

tryit &lt;- "use the `-c' switch\nlike this"
cat(shQuote(tryit), "\n")
## Not run: system(paste("echo", shQuote(tryit)))
cat(shQuote(tryit, type="csh"), "\n")

## Windows-only example.
perlcmd &lt;- 'print "Hello World\n";'
## Not run: shell(paste("perl -e", shQuote(perlcmd, type="cmd")))
